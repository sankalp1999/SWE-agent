# Flask Restaurant Management System Test Failures


## Critical Failure Details

### Primary Issue: Flask Application Instance Missing
**File**: output_restaurant_mgmt_system_flask/test_script.py:51
**Error**: `AssertionError: Flask application instance not found`

The test `test_init_file_contents` failed because the Flask application instance (`app`) was not found in the `__init__.py` file. This is the root cause that's likely causing the cascade of other failures.

### Related Failures
Two additional tests failed as a consequence:
- test_routes_file_contents
- test_test_routes_file_contents

Both failures stem from SQLAlchemy errors related to table definition conflicts.

## Root Cause
The application's initialization is incorrect. The `app` instance is either:
1. Not being created in `__init__.py`
2. Not being exposed at the module level
3. Being created with incorrect configuration
